Initially, this was [my](mailto:b.dewhirst@gmail.com) edits to someone else's [pbitutsky's](https://github.com/pbitutsky/webmonitor.git) code.
They created it as part of [their tutorial on Medium](https://medium.com/swlh/tutorial-creating-a-webpage-monitor-using-python-and-running-it-on-a-raspberry-pi-df763c142dac).

I subsequently modified the webmonitor code, and added some code to investigate a list of youtube links.
